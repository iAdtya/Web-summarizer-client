## Project
Web-summarizer generates summary of a given URL using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model and Puppeteer to
scrape the DOM. It also utilizes Redis to cache summaries, reducing overhead costs and improving
request speed from 4.4 seconds to 500 milliseconds The full backend is containerized and deployed on Railway with integrated Jest unit tests running on GitHub Actions for CI/CD and Winston for logging
